This repo contains a windows batch file script to modify the registry on windows so that popular browsers extend their manifest v2 availability.
It also contains a reg file if that is preferred instead.

If removals or undoing is desired, there is also a folder called REMOVALMETHODS where you can undo most changes.

Please use with your own discretion with knowledge of your environment.  Please always test beforehand.  It is unknown how long these will be supported by chromium.
